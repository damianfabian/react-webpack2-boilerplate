# react-webpack2-boilerplate
Webpack 2 Boilerplate to develop React Applications using CSS, ES6, Mocha, Chai, Istanbul and ESLint

## Why another React boilerplate?
I have been working with react for a while and I always have this config problems with new versions, new bugs or
those boilerplates are using some dependecies that does not allow me to see what is the current configuration in
a easy way to understand what is going on there and how everything is working on. So, I decided to make this boilerplate
with all the libraries ready to start just to create your App. I made it to understand how things work and then you could
change whatever you need to enhace your App.

## What you will get?
1. Webpack 2
2. React
3. Bootstrap (Only css)
4. React-Router
5. ESLint
6. Mocha, Chai, Enzyme (Unit Testing Framework)
7. Istanbul (Coverage)
8. React-Notification-System
9. Basic React Components (Button, Row, Column, Panel, Navigation)
10. Yarn

## Which features has this Boilerplate?
1. Login Page
2. Authentication by token in localStorage
3. Dashboard Page
4. Navigation (Active Links)
5. Notifications
